# Ecosystem Simulation Game / Second Project
(because it was developed based on C++ project and was extended with additional GUI iterface)

## Description
This project is a virtual simulation of an ecosystem where different organisms interact with each other. The ecosystem includes animals and plants that can move, eat, reproduce, and engage in various activities based on predefined rules.

## Features
- Organisms: The ecosystem consists of various organisms, including animals and plants.
- Human Control: One of the organisms, the Human, can be controlled using the WSAD keys.
- Graphical Interface: The simulation is displayed in a graphical interface with buttons representing the organisms on a 2D surface.
- Turn-Based Actions: Each turn, organisms perform actions such as moving, reproducing, and fighting.
- Console Logging: Noteworthy events related to procreation and conflicts are logged in the console for easy tracking.
- Initial State Setup: You can set up the initial state of the ecosystem using a default configuration, loading it from a file, or creating it manually.
- Randomized Initialization: The project offers the option to generate a random initial state for the ecosystem.
- State Export and Load: You can export the current state of the game to a file and load specific game states later on.
- Analyzing and Experimenting: This project provides an opportunity to observe and study the dynamics of an ecosystem, experiment with different setups, and analyze the outcomes of interactions between organisms.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
3. Set up your Java Development Kit (JDK) in VS Code if you haven't already. You can install the Java Extension Pack, which provides essential tools for Java development in VS Code, including language support, debugging capabilities, and more.
4. Install the Code Runner extension for VS Code. This extension allows you to run code snippets or entire Java files within the editor.
5. Open the SecondProject.java file in the editor and use the Code Runner extension to execute the code. You can do this by right-clicking anywhere in the file and selecting "Run Code" from the context menu.

## Additional Information
This project offers an opportunity to observe and study the dynamics of an ecosystem, experiment with different setups, and analyze the outcomes of interactions between organisms. It provides flexibility in setting up the initial state, saving and loading game states, and exploring various scenarios. The graphical interface and console logging enhance the visualization and tracking of organism activities, making it an engaging and educational simulation.
